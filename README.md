# CardGame_War
100 devs project - Card game War (v1)

Explanation: Draw two cards, a player wins if it has the biggest card.

Extra: The deck is being passed to localStorage so you keep playing with the same deck even if you refresh the page.

Missing: completion of the war phase of the game (cards have the same value)
